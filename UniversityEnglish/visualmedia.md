# Visual Media

## Media preference about myself

As a university student, the main way for me to contact with the latest things in the world is the mobile internet, for it can be accessed at nearly every time in a day. Therefore, the main types of media that influence me are all related to mobile internet. These types of media include forums about some special topics, like NGA (a forum made up by game lovers) and s1stage (a fourm consists of comic lovers), online video website like Bilibili (a Danmu video share platform) as well as live streaming like Douyu (Chinese counterpart of Twitch). But in my opinion, the most influencial media what we called social media. The new form of media makes it possible for every individual to be the source of information, to share their views with other people, to get attention they can not get in the ordinary life. Though it is hard to admit, I usually spend more than an hour on social media everyday, which means it is not only an important source of information, but also a great distraction for me from my schoolwork.

## Visual Media preference about university students

For university students in this era, as mentioned above, social media over mobile internet makes up a huge part of their daily contact with media. Students take part in the discussions online by reading and writing online. In addition to social media, video websites are also popular among students, which is a substitution for TV among the young people. In addition to these two popular media, different students may have different preference. For instance, some of the students may enjoy watching live streaming and browse forums while others may enjoy reading books borrowed from the library. As for video games, in some ways it can also be defined as a kind of media, are also popular among students. In conclusion, we can find that almost everything is related to the Internet, and because almost everything on the Internet have something to show on screen, vision is the most important way for students to access to the new media in Internet age.

2017 oct
around Mosul

With the attack for retaking Mosul by the anti-ISIL allies, thousands of refugees fled from the battle field around Mosul in october, 2017. Refugees' camps were set near the conflict area to accommodate these refugees. After the rough but sweet journey on boat or foot, these people can finally get rid of the veils and taboos laid on them by ISIL, and reunited with their beloved family members.

The man in the picture was once fined for smoking in ISIL controled area and threatened to be executed the next time. Now he has already fled from the control of ISIL, yet with no money, no house left.

## Some Topics to do for task 1.

### Education-Education Fairness

In China, many people belivev that getting enough education is the best way for then to have an access to the upper level. However, it seems harder for poor students in rural areas to win in the competation for a ticket to higher education. As a recent report by Peking University suggests, the students who get into Peking University from rural country decrased sharply in the past 20 years. When students in center city enjoy the perority of abundant educational resource, the students in counery still suffer from the lack of well trained teachers. At the same time, people always say that the kids are suffering from overwheelming schoolwork and the government should release the stress on the students. However, is releasing stress the right thing to do for the people in rural area? When urban students spent so many money and time on study, how can stunents in edu-less-developed area reach their dream school? More serviously, how much will it contributes to the class solidification in China?

### Gaming-ESports

Gaming had been seen as flood and monster in China for several years, however, when the first generation grow up with e-game become the main work force of the society and the development of mobile Internet, the public view for video games seems to be changed.

With the fast growing of live streaming under the help of mobile Internet, ESports draws more and more people to pay attention to them, therefore more and more captial is coming into this area, which helps Esports to become a hot industrial all over the world. Bllizard Entertainment in the U.S. was favored by the capital recently, for it founded its Overwatch League. Vaule gains millions of dollars from the Ti series, which is a global championship on dota2. How does the industrial runs, and how can capital get reward from it. What are the players like in their real life? There are so may things to be discussed about e-sports.

### Computers-FPGA

If you spend at least 10 minutes on exploring news on the Internet, you must have heard of Bitcoin, which is a kind of digital curency and it has already been used by many people. You may have also heard of cloud calculation service, like AWS by amazon and Azure by Mircosoft. Some of you may know about the deep learning technology. These new technology all have connections with a kind of hardware called FPGA.

FPGA, which is short for Field－Programmable Gate Array, is a kind of hardware that can be used for acclearing certain calculations. Along with the fast development of the 3 technology mentioned above, the need for FPGA is rising sharply, because the speed of calculation is quite important for these fields and FPGA can calculate much more quickly than CPUS which can be universally used.
