## Introduction

Recently, rapid development in the field of mobile Internet have heightened the need for take-out. The Big Data technology and the Mobile Internet technology have seen the fast growth  of take-out market(iiMedia Research, 2016). According to the report from Institute of Frontier Industry Research in 2016, the whole market of online take-out selling will reach at 118 billion yuan per year at the end of 2017. We can safely predict that the take-out market will grow even faster in the following few years (iiMedia Research, 2017). In the meantime, college students make a cosiderable contribution to the hypergrowth of take-out. TrustData found a strong relationship between the number of take-out orders and the number of universities, which also suggests that students consumed a large number of online take-out(TrustData, 2017). However, no math model of university students' take-out ordering behavior pattern has been developed by now. Despite many reports focusing on the whole market of take-out, none of them is detailed enough to show the purchasing behavior pattern on campus. There have also been reports made by other universities’ students which are based on rather casual questionnaires and guesses (Li, 2015). These reports failed to reveal the behavior pattern of online take-out ordering.

This paper seeks to find out the behavior pattern of online take-out ordering and the relationships among all these factors by analyisng the data obtained from UCAS’s Yuquan campus. After the analysis of the results of 107 questionnaires, the result clearly showed two different behavior patterns of take-out orderers. Based on the analysis, we provide a method to conjecture one's take-out ordering behavior according to his daily routine. The method enables us to provide useful suggestions for the university's logistics department and take-out providers.

## Methods

Large amount of data is required to support a latent behavior pattern.  Consequently, an efficient way of data collecting is required.  Finally, we adopted the method of online questionnaire.  An online questionnaire enables us to directly obtain digital data through the backstage, which is convenient to manipulate especially when the sample scale is large. 

In order to obtain an overall conclusion, we tried to cover a wide range of questions in the questionnaire.  However, a redundant questionnaire is time-consuming and will lead to a significantly low recovering rate.  Consequently, the quantity of questions is supposed to be limited.  The contents of the questionnaire are listed as follows:

1.	Online ordering frequency
2.	Online ordering time preference
3.	Online ordering platform
4.	Online ordering price range and the proportion to life expenses
5.	Main factors considered in online ordering
6.	Main reasons for choosing takeout
7.	Degree of concern about takeout hygiene
8.	Parents' attitude towards takeout
9.	Students’ general evaluations of takeout.
10.	Conditions in which the students will give up ordering online 

The options were carefully set that we took many factors into consideration.  Take the question about online ordering price range as an example.  The lowest discount price of most stores is set in the range of 20-30 yuan in eleme app.  A part of the students possibly order what they want only.  However, most of the students, in order to use the red envelopes, have to purchase food valued over 35 yuan.  The final cost will consequently exceed 25 yuan.  As a result, we set the price range as below: <15 rmb/order”, ”15-25 rmb/order”, ”25-50rmb/order”, ”>50 rmb/order”.  These details enable us to obtain well-directed data.

The object of the survey is the undergraduates in the Yuquanlu campus of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as UCAS).  In order to include a large number of participants, we posted our online questionnaire on major social platforms including QQ and WeChat.  We finally received in total 105 sets of questionnaire answers, of which 103 are valid.  2 responses were eliminated because though the participants confirmed that they ordered take-out, they called for deliveries at a frequency of null.  Though the rest of answers are valid, drawbacks still exist.  Due to the feature of online questionnaire, we have no access to the number of people who have viewed the questionnaire.  As a result, the recovery rate of the questionnaire remains unknown.  In addition, the title of the questionnaire is Take-out in UCAS.  We suspect that undergraduates who never conducted online ordering probably overlooked the questionnaire.  In conclusion, it is not a perfect sampling of undergraduates in UCAS and we are not able to conclude the ratio of take-out users according to the data as intended.  In addition, we have to admit that the meaning of options in a few questions were not explicit enough for participants.  They could be variously interpreted, which brought us some problems.  We also found that some of the questions were poorly related to each other.  As a result, it was difficult for us to conclude rules according to the data.  We then adopted a powerful tool named EM algorithm.

The ExpectationCMaximization (EM) algorithm is able to rule out redundant information.  We expected to explore possible relationships among various factors.  EM algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of parameters in statistical models, where the model depends on unobserved latent variables (Wikipedia).  It conducts an expectation (E) step and a maximization (M) step in turn repeatedly.  To make it simple, we can describe the expectation (E) step as a step to guess the result, while maximization (M) step is a step to check and correct the guess with the data.  Through the process, it is able to find a latent pattern and determine the distribution of variables in the pattern. 

<!-- ### 1. Questionnaire design

We adopt the method of online questionnaire. The object of the survey is all the undergraduates in the Yuquanlu campus of University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (hereinafter referred to as UCAS).  

We posted our online questionnaire on all the major social platforms. It is convenient to collect the data through the backstage especially when the sample scale is large.

The contents of the questionnaire are listed as follows:    

#### 1. Consumption situation on online ordering

1. Online ordering frequency: the options were set as follows: ”never”, ”no more than three times a month”, ”several times a week”, ”almost once a day”, ”two or three times a day”.
1. Online ordering time: the options were set as follows: ”mostly on weekends”, ”mostly on weekdays”, ”whenever I want”.
1. Online ordering platform: the options included three most commonly used takeout platforms.
1. Online ordering price range: the options were set as follows: ”<15 rmb/share”, ”15-25 rmb/share”, ”25-50rmb/share”,”>50 rmb/share”. 

Take the Eleme app as an example. The lowest discount price of most stores is set in the range of 20-30 yuan. A part of the students possibly order what they want only. However, most of the students, in order to use the red envelopes, have to purchase food valued over 35 yuan. The final cost will consequently exceed 25 yuan. As a result, we set the price range as above. 
#### 2. Influence factors on online ordering

1. The main factors considered in online ordering: we considered subjective needs of consumers and quality of store's service as two major factors. In addition, we provided several other options, “Other-Specify” included.
1. The main reasons for choosing online ordering: we provided following options: ”felt bad about food in canteen“, “felt crowded in canteen”, “got coupons “, ”be recommended by others”, “joined others to obtain a discount”, “missed the meal time”, ”expected for a big meal”, “refused to go out”, “had too much money”, an “Other-Specify” is also included.

#### 3. Other views on takeout

In this part, we investigated the degree of concern about takeout hygiene, the degree of parents' support for children ordering online and students’ general evaluations of takeout. We also added a fill - in question to investigate conditions in which the students will give up ordering online, hoping to collect more information for later analysis.

In our survey, we received totally 105 sets of questionnaire answers, of which 103 are valid.  2 responses were eliminated because though the participants confirmed that they ordered take-out, they called for deliveries at a frequency of null. According to the data, over half of the students had take-out several times a week. A Similar percentage of students mostly had take-out on weekends. The major factor which students considered when ordering online is the price along with the taste. It is partly confirmed by following data. Around sixty percent of students spent 15 to 25 yuan per share. Half of them allocated less than 15 percent of their living expenses to take-out. In addition, both parents and children worried little about take-out hygiene. The reasons why students chose to have take-out are highly diversified.  Poor impression on canteen contributed to the popularity of take-out because over half of the students spoke evilly about the taste of dishes offered in canteen. -->

## Result

### 1. Line of thinking

The analyzation for the gained data can be sorted into four stages. Firstly, the data were manually analyzed to check if some basic rules can be find. Secondly, different algorithms were applied in order to find the suitest one for the following research. In this stage, the EM algorithm was proved to the the best tool. The EM algorithm was then adopted, and the result was checked manually to see if it could be further improved. Finally, the EM algorithm's parameter and the source data were changed according to the result of the last stage, and the result of second trial was taken as the final result. 

### 2. Basic analyzing of the data

We first finished preliminary analysis of the data. Before setting out to find interal relationships among data, we ruled out some invalid information. Some of the questions were not set properly. Consequently, their results have no reference value.

<!-- ![res1.png](res1.png)
_Figure 2.1. Do you order online?_|
-|-

It is a seemingly meaningful result that three fourths of the students order online. However, we conducted the survey with an online questionnaire, which means we have no access to obtain the recovery rate of the questionnaire.  In addition, the title of our questionnaire is Take-out in UCAS.  As a result, undergraduates who never conducted online ordering probably overlooked the questionnaire.  In conclusion, it is not a proper sampling of undergraduates in UCAS.  Consequently, we are not able to conclude the ratio of take-out users according to the answers of our second question. -->

![res2.png](res2.png)
_Figure 2.2. What factors will you consider when choosing take-out?_| 
-|-

The options of the question were not properly set because the meaning of the word preference was not explicit enough for participants. As a result, the fourth option has various interpretations.  In conclusion, the result of the question is invalid strictly.

To cover all possible factors which affect students’ take-out ordering behavior, we set a large number of questions. In addition, some of the questions were poorly related to each other. Yet we cannot just judge them as redundant.  Therefore, it is difficult to conclude rules manually according to the simply-processed data.

### 3. Preliminary analysis

As it is impossible to find latent rules with the simply-processed data, our group chose to adopt machine learning algorithm to analyze these data. Before formally starting mining the data, we did preliminary studies to find a promising direction. For there were many algorithms to choose from, we chose to test each valid algorithm in Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) using the initial parameter provided by the software. We then compared the results for seek of the best one.

|Algorithm|Bayes-Net|Naive-Bayes-Net|Logistic|SMO|DecisionTable|J48|EM|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Kappa|0.0382|0.0243|-0.0724|0.1181|0.0003|0.0709|x|

result|
-|-

The result above revealed that all the classification algorithm provided results with kappa less than 0.2. Some of them even had negative kappa value which means the results were worse than that from random classification. The same circumstance repeated when we tried the association algorithms. Surprisingly, the EM algorithm, though failing to offer a clear classification for specially appointed attribute (hence its kappa could not be calculated), did provide meaningful findings with disordered data. As a result, the EM algorithm was adopted for further mining job. 

<!-- ### 4. Basic analyzation -->

### 4. Applying the Expectation Maximization Algorithm

The EM Algorithm, as its name suggests, is an algorithm used for classification of a known data set which has max expectation (Do, C. B., & Batzoglou, S. (2008)). In this experiment, we used the EM algorithm included in Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) by the University of Waikato.

At the very beginning, we applied the EM algorithm directly to the pre-processed data, the first trial used the following parameters:

```
weka.clusterers.EM -I 100 -N -1 -X 10 -max -1 -ll-cv 1.0E-6 -ll-iter 1.0E-6 -M 1.0E-6 -K 10 -num-slots 1 -S 100
```

The head of the results are listed as follow.

The result includes a large quantaty of data, with which we failed to concluded significant results. However, the EM algorithm did succeed in seperating raw data into two different sets with similar size. For most of the attributes in the result list, the difference was not obvious. However, for some of the binary attributes, the classification matrix showed that the 2 sets generated by this algorithm had huge difference in these attributes. We picked out these attributes as following:

The attributes listed above had obvious difference between the two groups. Since this was only the preliminary result generated by the EM algorithm with the initial parameters, we could claim that it could still be improved. 

### 5. Improve the Algorithm: Further Data Process

#### 5-1. General View

In the first trial, we took 25 factors into consideration. However, according to the result, only some of them showed great differences in the two sets. While the other attributes had no significant contribution to the classification. For instance:

```
WHY-WANNAEATBETTER (The participant choose taken-out for he wants to eat better)
  no                    31.5739 25.4261
  yes                   16.4403 10.5597
  [total]               48.0142 35.9858

WHY-AWFULCANTEEN (The participant choose taken-out for he can not bear the canteen)
  no                    25.9073  5.0927
  yes                   20.7473 32.2527
  [total]               46.6546 37.3454
```

From the matrix above, we can conclude that the two groups of participants share similar distribution of the percentage of people choosing take-out for better meals. However, the two groups differ significantly in the attitudes towards the school canteen. In the left group, only half of its members claim that the canteen is awful, while in the other group, more than 80% of participants hold the idea that the canteen is unbearable. In fact, there are 15 attributes differ significantly between the two groups.

Yet it was only the first trail with the raw data and initial parameters, doing further process of these attributes would undoubtly improve the outcome. We took two measures then: deleting useless data and merging similar options. 

#### 5-2. Delete Useless Attributes

For some of the attributes, the participants' choices gathered together in single options. 

![attr](style.png)

_Figure 5.1. Pre-processed data_|
-|-

For instance, in attributes like WHY-MATESUGGEST (which asked if the responder choose to order take-out because of other people's suggest), were greatly imbalanced. As the graph suggested, few participants order take-out because others' suggest. In this situation, this attribute can be deleted in the next EM test, for it can hardly provide any useful information for classification. According to the principle of EM. , deleting them will not harm the general result. Also, if left not processed, these imbalance attributes will introduce more randomness into the result of EM. Attributes with similar conditions are:

```
WHY-IAMRICH
CHOOSE-ELSE
WHERE-ELSE
WHY-MATESSUGGEST
WHY-TASTE
CHOOSE-SERVICE
WHY-NOOUTDOOR
```
_Table 5.2.  Attributes chosen_|
-|-
These attributes were removed to improve the result.

<!-- For we have found that other attributes showed no great difference in the two groups, -->

#### 5-3. Merge Similar options

Not only the common pattern will make blur of the results, but also one question with many different options can also add up to the difficulty of data analyzing. To avoid this, we chose to merge the options of such questions.

Taking the attribute "score for canteen" for instance. In the questionnaire, the question asking participants to make a score for the canteen was designed to be a Likert scale (Likert summated rating scale). The advantage of Likert scale is that it can show the slight difference in attitudes towards the canteen. Unfortunately, this design also made the result too complicated for the algorithm to work smoothly. To be more specific, the algorithm does not know the relationship between "dislike" and "hate", hence it considered these 2 options as 2 completely different emotions. While in fact, they were both negative emotions. Therefore, merge such options together as "negative attitude" can greatly improve the outcome of the algorithm (林东方, 2012).

This method was applied to "PRICE", "AT-TIME", "FREQUENCY", "SCORE-CANTEEN", "SCORE_TAKEOUT2s" and "SPEND-PERCENTAGE".

Attributes with merged options are like following.
```
SCORE-CANTEEN
  neutral               33.9477 26.0523
  positive               10.721   5.279

<!-- ### 7. Verifying of the final result by EM. -->
Above is the final result generated by EM algorithm. Compared with the first result, this one divided the participants into two groups differ more significantly.

This result can be repeated using the data set with the following command on Weka:
```
weka.clusterers.EM -I 100 -N -1 -X 10 -max -1 -ll-cv 1.0E-6 -ll-iter 1.0E-6 -M 1.0E-6 -K 10 -num-slots 1 -S 100
```

### 7. Analysis for the Final Result

Combining the result of the EM algorithm and the result of the basic analyzing, we can roughly divide the take-out orderers in UCAS into two groups. Generally, the first group can be described as people who have negative attitudes towards the canteen, most of them highly evaluated take-out, and enjoyed ordering take-out together with their roommates. Meanwhile, most of them also believes that the canteen is too crowded some times.

The other group of people share different characteristic with the first group of people. While half of them claim that they choose take-out because the canteen is too awful (which is far less than the first group, in which almost all the people believes that the awful canteen is the reason for them to order take-out), they order take-out mainly because of they missed the time for lunch or dinner. These people order take-out mainly at the weekends, and they are less likely to share take-out with their friends.

To sum up, the first group of people can be defined as those who do not like the school canteen so that they choose to take take-out, while another group, which is similar in size with the first group, order take-out mainly because they want food out of the meal time and dinner time.

## Discussion

With the method of supervised machine learning, our study summarized the behavior pattern of the UCAS take-out orderers for the first time. 

In the model built by the EM algorithm, we find two kinds of groups with obvious differences in online-ordering behavior. People in one of them are not satisfied with the university canteen. People in the other group order take-out only for sake of its efficiency. Compared with other research on university students' take-out ordering , this research provides a quantified model for take-out ordering, which is more convincing and repeatable. By using this model, we can speculate a person's taken-out ordering behavior pattern with limited information.

Some suggestions can be given from the result of our study:

#### 1. Recommendations for the stores:

Most students are more willing to accept 15-25 yuan / order takeout. Stores can try to keep the profit while controlling the price within the range of 15-25 yuan / single, which might increase the sales. At the same time, the hygiene problem is one of the important areas which students are concerned about. Over 90% of the students worry about the hygiene safety of takeout to varying degrees. Stores should also pay attention to food hygiene and packaging forms in order to provide customers with better dining experience.

#### 2. Recommendations for canteens:

Most of the students give poor evaluation of college cantee, due to poor food taste and crowded environment. The canteen should frequently provide new dishes which prevents students from boredom. The canteen can also lengthen the meal time to meet the needs of more students. In addition, over 40% of the participants said they would give up takeout as long as the canteen improved their food and service. Therefore, the performance of college canteen may even affect the takeout ordering behavior pattern of students.

#### 3. Recommendations for students:

It turns out that over half of the students formed a habit of ordering online, and the major reason for them to choose takeout is laziness: they just don't want to leave the dormitory. We should not only focus on the convenience brought by technology but also notice the latent health risks. A healthy lifestyle requires more exercise instead of lying on the bed.

However, drawbacks of this research do exist. The greatest challenge is from the data we have access to. We suspect that take-out ordering is also related to academic achievement and physical fitness of the orderers. However, for two limitation factors listed as follow, the doubt cannot be discussed in this paper. 

The first limitation is the content of questionnaire. Experience tells us that too many questions will lead to poor recovery rate. In our questionnaire there are already 14 questions. As a result, it is unwise to add any question.

The second limitation is about privacy of participants. For the fact that some participants are not willing to mention their GPA, it is hard to gather data related to academic performance. In addition, it is also impossible to take use of publicized information about grades, because the questionnaire is anonymous.

As a result, the research only focus on take-out ordering behavior itself. We believe that further research on the relationship between take-out ordering and othor factors will lead to more exciting discovery.
